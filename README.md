# Clicker Class
Adds the 'Clicker Class', a joke set of weapons. Don't hurt yourself!

## Mod Compatibility
If you wish to add clicker related content in your own mod, head over to our [ClickerClassExampleMod](https://github.com/SamsonAllen13/ClickerClassExampleMod) repo.

## Localization
If you wish to contribute translations, visit the [tML wiki page](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Contributing-Localization) on that.
This mod uses `.hjson` files in the `Localization` folder.
For now, refer to the english file for up-to-date text. Only translate the righthand side (after the `:`), and don't touch things inside curly brackets (`{ }`)!
